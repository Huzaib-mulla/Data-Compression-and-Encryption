**Data compression**

Data compression is the process of modifying, encoding or converting the bits structure of data in such a way that it consumes less space on disk.
It enables reducing the storage size of one or more data instances or elements. Data compression is also known as source coding or bit-rate reduction.

**Data Encryption**

Encryption is a security method in which information is encoded in such a way that only authorized user can read it. It uses encryption algorithm to generate ciphertext that can only be read if decrypted.
Types of Encryption
1) Symmetric Key encryption

2) Public Key encryption
